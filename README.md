Vibe-coded text-to-emoji app with these Claude prompts:


1. Create a new javascript app that lets a user type in one or two lines of text, up to 4 characters per line, and generates a 128 x 128 pixel emoji with the text on a solid color round rect. Provide controls for the user to choose the font, the text color, and the background color of the round rect.

1. Thanks! Can you also add a font size control to allow the font to be made larger, with less padding at the edges of the round rect

1. Can you a new slider to adjust the line spacing, so that I could increase the spacing between the two lines of text

1. Can you also add a slider for adjusting the corner radius of the round rect?

1. please use the queryLocalFonts API to augment the list of fonts with all the user's local fonts

1. In the javascript console, I see an error that says "Error loading local fonts: SecurityError: User activation is required". I don't see any local fonts in the dropdown menu. Could you help get this working?
